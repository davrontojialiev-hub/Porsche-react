          Porsche is a German automotive company founded in 1931 by Ferdinand
          Porsche, an engineer who had previously worked on designing cars such
          as the Volkswagen Beetle. Today, Porsche is one of the most renowned
          and respected manufacturers of premium-class vehicles, specializing in
          sports cars, SUVs, and sedans, combining high performance, luxury, and
          innovative technologies in its models. The company's most iconic model
          is the Porsche 911, introduced in 1964. This car, with its rear-engine
          layout and unique design, quickly gained popularity and has since
          maintained its status, becoming a true icon of the automotive world.
          The development of the 911 was so successful that it set the brand's
          overall style and remains the foundation of Porsche to this day.
          Porsche has always been known for its technological achievements. The
          company’s engineers were among the first to use lightweight carbon
          materials, improve aerodynamics, and refine suspension systems,
          achieving exceptional handling and stability at high speeds. Porsche
          is also famous for its success in motorsport, where its models
          regularly place highly, including in prestigious races such as the 24
          Hours of Le Mans.
